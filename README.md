## Setup
Seed database - 1 user (coach runner), 1 area (Wandsworth, of course), 12 randomly generated runners with varied statuses and interests
No mechanic was added for an Area Trainer to add themselves to an Area- assumed that this was done centrally
Sending emails will open up tabs in chrome with the emails listed. Kept the runners down to 12 to not make this too annoying.

## Email Logic
Subjects change depending on Runner status

Email content is based on combination of status and interests. Everyone receives the blurb about what's been going on, whilst only Group Runners will receive what the group just did. If the runner is interested in group runs but is lapsed or never_run then they will receive a prompt "will we see you on a group run soon?"
Similarly if the runner is interested in missions they will receive a prompt "have you signed up for a mission?" and if interested in coach runs and lapsed/never_run then "We'll have you running to a coach soon"
